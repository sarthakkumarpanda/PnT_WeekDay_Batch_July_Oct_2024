	//Arrays are nothing but data storage houses
	//Arrays are part of Data Structures
	//Arrays will store homogeneous elements [data of the same type]
	//Size of the array is pre-determined.
	//Indexing position of arrays start from zero
	//Arrays are represented in the form of dimensions []
	//Parent class of array is Object class
	//Length(size) of the array is determined using length attribute

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//store 10 integers
		
		int a[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100};
		
		String b[] = {"Java", "Python", "Javascript", "Ruby", "Perl" };
		
		boolean c[] = { 1<2 , true, 3 != 2, 2 == 2, false, 1>2 };
		
		//Advantages of array
		//save time, save memory, store multiple elements
		//arrays have indexing position. So accessing the values inside the array becomes easy
		
		//Let's say total elements in an array is n
		//first value will be 0th index
		//last value will be (n-1)th index
