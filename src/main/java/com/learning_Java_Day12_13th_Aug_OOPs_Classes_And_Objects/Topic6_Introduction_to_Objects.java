	//Object is instance[a specific occurrence] of a class
	
	//Objects occupy physical memory
	//Objects have a physical identifications. They are physical entities
	
	//Animal - can act as a Class. Animal is a logical entity
	
	//How do we differentiate an Object from a Class
	//1. Identity [name]
	//2. State [Breed / Color / Age]
	//3. Behavior [Barking / Drinking / Eating/ Sleeping / GuardingHouse]
	
	//Reason1: Determining dimensions of a class is very difficult
	//Reason2: Observe the behavior of an Object
	//Reason3: Objects can be better nomenclatured but Classes cannot
